abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations rely on integrating the classical (Newtonian) equations of motion for a molecular system and thus, sample a microcanonical (constant-energy) ensemble by default. However, for compatibility with experiment, it is often desirable to sample configurations from a canonical (constant-temperature) ensemble instead. A modification of the basic molecular dynamics scheme with the purpose of maintaining the temperature constant (on average) is called a thermostat algorithm. The present article reviews the various thermostat algorithms proposed to date, their physical basis, their advantages and their shortcomings. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract = {We report a serious problem associated with a number of current implementations of Andersen and Langevin dynamics algorithms. When long simulations are run in many segments, it is sometimes possible to have a repeating sequence of pseudorandom numbers enter the calcuation. We show that, if the sequence repeats rapidly, the resulting artifacts can quickly denature biomolecules and are then easily detectable. However, if the sequence repeats less frequently, the artifacts become subtle and easily overlooked. We derive a formula for the underlying cause of artifacts in the case of the Langevin thermostat, and find it vanishes slowly as the inverse square root of the number of time steps per simulation segment. Numerous examples of simulation artifacts are presented, including dissociation of a tetrameric protein after 110 ns of dynamics, reductions in atomic fluctuations for a small protein in implicit solvent, altered thermodynamic properties of a box of water molecules, and changes in the transition free energies between dihedral angle conformations. Finally, in the case of strong thermocoupling, we link the observed artifacts to previous work in nonlinear dynamics and show that it is possible to drive a 20-residue, implicitly solvated protein into periodic trajectories if the thermostat is not used properly. Our findings should help other investigators re-evaluate simulations that may have been corrupted and obtain more accurate results. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We carry out a mathematical study of the Andersen thermostat [1], which is a frequently used tool in molecular dynamics. After reformulating the continuous-and discrete-time Andersen dynamics, we prove that in both cases the Andersen dynamics is uniformly ergodic. A detailed numerical analysis is presented, establishing the rate of convergence of most commonly used numerical algorithms for the Andersen thermostat. Transport properties such as the diffusion constant are also investigated. It is proved for the Lorentz gas model where there is intrinsic diffusion that the diffusion coefficient calculated using the Andersen thermostat converges to the true diffusion coefficient in the limit of vanishing collision frequency in the Andersen thermostat. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Stoyanov2005,
abstract = {This paper proposes a novel thermostat applicable to any particle-based dynamic simulation. Each pair of particles is thermostated either (with probability P) with a pairwise Lowe-Andersen thermostat [C. P. Lowe, Europhys. Lett. 47, 145 (1999)] or (with probability 1-P) with a thermostat that is introduced here, which is based on a pairwise interaction similar to the No{\'{s}}-Hoover thermostat. When the pairwise No{\'{s}}-Hoover thermostat dominates (low P), the liquid has a high diffusion coefficient and low viscosity, but when the Lowe-Andersen thermostat dominates, the diffusion coefficient is low and viscosity is high. This novel No{\'{s}}-Hoover-Lowe- Andersen thermostat is Galilean invariant and preserves both total linear and angular momentum of the system, due to the fact that the thermostatic forces between each pair of the particles are pairwise additive and central. We show by simulation that this thermostat also preserves hydrodynamics. For the (noninteracting) ideal gas at P=0, the diffusion coefficient diverges and viscosity is zero, while for P{\textgreater}0 it has a finite value. By adjusting probability P, the Schmidt number can be varied by orders of magnitude. The temperature deviation from the required value is at least an order of magnitude smaller than in dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), while the equilibrium properties of the system are very well reproduced. The thermostat is easy to implement and offers a computational efficiency better than (DPD), with better temperature control and greater flexibility in terms of adjusting the diffusion coefficient and viscosity of the simulated system. Applications of this thermostat include all standard molecular dynamic simulations of dense liquids and solids with any type of force field, as well as hydrodynamic simulation of multiphase systems with largely different bulk viscosities, including surface viscosity, and of dilute gases and plasmas. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},
