  abstract = {The thesis presents three molecular dynamics studies of polymeric ensembles in which the chain entanglement plays the major role in the internal dynamics of the system. A coarse-grained model is used for representing the polymer chains as strings of beads connected by finite-extensible springs. In a dense ensemble of such chains, the strong bonds along the polymer backbone coupled with the repulsive Lennard-Jones interaction between unconnected beads prevent the chains from crossing each other. This results in an entangled system with motion restrictions for each chain imposed by the intertwining with the neighboring ones. Studying the chain dynamics inside entangled ensembles of identical chains is the main purpose of this thesis. Due to the entanglement, the polymers are restricted to a reptation motion. The chain movement is influenced significantly by chain length N, temperature T and chain stiffness. In order to analyze the effect of these parameters, three systems were investigated by computer simulation. The polymer melt: at relatively high temperatures, the ensemble of entangled polymers behaves like a highly viscous fluid. Above the entanglement length N {\textgreater} Ne, in the reptation regime, the chain self-diffusion decreases with the square of the chain length. This is in contrast with a linear dependence on N predicted by Einstein's relations and applicable only to short chains in Rouse regime. The polymer glass: as the temperature is lowered below the glass transition temperature (T {\textless} Tg), the diffusion process ceases. The system enters the glassy state characterized by structural arrest in which the local random bead motion is ineffective in inducing large-scale chain diffusion. The adhesion between two polymer bulks via connector chains: the adhesion strength is measured in debonding simulations. As the two polymer bulks are pulled apart the connector chains are forced to disentangle from the bulks following a reptation motion. Remarkably, the total work necessary to break the adhesion is again proportional to the square of the connector length. This confirms that the entanglement of the connectors inside the polymer bulks is the essential mechanism realizing the bondage. The prominent contribution of this thesis is the systematic study of how these phenomena are influenced by the chain stiffness, modeled by a bending potential and a novel form of torsion potential acting on three, respectively four, successive beads along the polymer backbone. By incorporating chain stiffness, our study shows that the effects of chain entanglement become more evident: as chain stiffness is enhanced, the entanglement length (Ne) increases, the glass transition occurs at higher temperatures (Tg) and the adhesion via connector chains becomes stronger. The results reported in this thesis are based on a massive computational effort amounting to about 10 CPU years.},

  abstract = {We report new macro-rheological results extracted from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of Couette flow. We investigate atomic liquids for new state points, and in addition two types of dumbbell liquids: (1) finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) and (2) newly defined generalized Lennard-Jones (GLJ), up to a nondimensional shear rate of 15. The dumbbell liquids exhibit shear thinning, non-zero first and second normal stress differences, and volumetric dilatancy. These effects are weakly sensitive to details in shape of the intra-molecular potentials, and to the dominant frequency associated with vibrations of dumbbells. However, the Newtonian viscosity of dumbbell liquids strongly depends on the size of dumbbells. The onset of shear thinning of FENE and GLJ dumbbells is delayed to higher shear rates in comparison with atomic liquids. In general, for the entire investigated region, we see that dumbbells are slightly more elastic than atomic liquids. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@article{Lima2016,
  abstract = {In this paper, the surface effects of individual heavy ions impacting thin polymerlike films were investigated, using molecular dynamics simulations with the finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential to describe the molecular chains. The perturbation introduced by the ions in the lattice was modeled assuming that the initial excitation energy in the ion track is converted into an effective temperature, as in a thermal spike. The track was heated only within the film thickness h, leaving a nonexcited substrate below. The effect of decreasing thickness on cratering and sputtering was evaluated. The results were compared to experimental data of thin polymer films bombarded by MeV-GeV ions and to simulations performed with the Lennard-Jones potential. While several qualitative results observed in the experiments were also seen in the simulations, irrespective of the potential used, there are important differences observed on FENE films. Crater dimensions, rim volume, and sputtering yields are substantially reduced, and a threshold thickness for molecular ejection appears in FENE simulations. This is attributed to the additional restrictions on mass transport out of the excited track region imposed by interchain interactions (entanglements) and by the low mobility of the molten phase induced by the spike.},

  abstract = {The ability of a simple coarse-grained finite-extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) Lennard-Jones (LJ) polymer model to be crystallized is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The optimal FENE Lennard-Jones parameter combinations (ratio between FENE and LJ equilibrium distances) and the optimal lattice parameters are calculated for five different perfect crystallite structures: simple tetragonal, body-centered tetragonal, body-centered orthorhombic, hexagonal primitive, and hexagonal close packed. It was found that the most energetically favorable structure is the body-centered orthorhombic. Starting with an equilibrated polymer liquid and with the optimal parameters found for the body-centered orthorhombic, an isothermal treatment led to the formation of large lamellar crystallites with a typical chain topology: folded, loop, and tie chains, and with a crystallinity of about 60{\%}-70{\%}, similar to real semicrystalline polymers. This simple coarse-grained Lennard-Jones model provides a qualitative tool to study semicrystalline microstructures for polymers.},

The FENE-P model predicts the FENE behaviour unsatisfactorily. However, we will show that its performance can be substantially improved. We propose to determine the parameters in the FENE-P model such that important FENE flow characteristics are recovered. The three resulting models (FENE, FENE-P and the proposed FENE-P model) will first be compared in the above-mentioned rheometrical flows. To show that the improvement persists in a complex flow field, we also simulate the flow of the FENE fluid past a cylinder using the Brownian configuration field technique. We then compare the results with those of the proposed FENE-P model and those of the original FENE-P model. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
