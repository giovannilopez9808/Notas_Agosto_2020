abstract = {A semi-empirical interatomic potential for carbon has been developed, based on the modified embedded atom method formalism. The potential describes the structural properties of various polytypes of carbon, elastic, defect and surface properties of diamonds as satisfactorily as the well-known Tersoff potential. Combined with the Lennard-Jones potential, it can also reproduce the physical properties of graphite and amorphous carbon reasonably well. The applicability of the present potential to atomistic approaches on carbon nanotubes and fullerenes is also shown. The potential has the same formalism as previously developed MEAM potentials for bcc, fcc and hcp elements, and can be easily extended to describe various metal-carbon alloy systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The variable soft sphere (VSS) molecular model is introduced for both the viscosity and diffusion cross sections (coefficients) to be consistent with those of the inverse-power-law (IPL) or Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. The VSS model has almost the same analytical and computational simplicity (computation time) as the variable hard sphere (VHS) model in the Monte Carlo simulation of rarefied gas flows. The null-collision Monte Carlo method is used to make comparative calculations for the molecular diffusion in a heat-bath gas and the normal shock wave structure in a simple gas. For the most severe test of the VSS model for the IPL potential, the softest practical model corresponding to the Maxwell molecule is chosen. The agreement in the molecular diffusion and shock wave structure between the VSS model and the IPL or LJ potential is remarkably good. {\textcopyright} 1991 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Girifalco2000,
abstract = {The potential energies of interaction between two parallel, infinitely long carbon nanotubes of the same diameter, and between C60 and a nanotube in various arrangements, were computed by assuming a continuous distribution of atoms on the tube and ball surfaces and using a Lennard-Jones (LJ) carbon-carbon potential. The constants in the LJ potential are different for graphene-graphene and C60-C60 interactions. From these, the constants for tube-C60 interactions were estimated using averaging rules from the theory of dispersion forces. For tubes in ropes, the cohesive energy per unit length, the compressibility, and the equilibrium separation distance were computed as a function of tube radius. For a C60 molecule interacting with tubes, the binding energy inside a tube was much higher than on a tube or at the tube mouth. Within a tube, the binding energy was highest at a spherically capped end. The potential energies for tubes of all radii, as well as for interactions between C60 molecules, for a C60 molecule outside of a nanotube, between a C60 molecule and a graphene sheet, and between graphene sheets, all fell on the same curve when plotted in terms of certain reduced parameters. Because of this, all the potentials can be represented by a simple analytic form, thereby greatly simplifying all computations of van der Waals interactions in graphitic systems. Binding-energy results were all consistent with the recently proposed mechanism of peapod formation based on transmission electron microscopy experiments.},

@article{Nose1991,
abstract = {How the canonical distribution is realized in simulations based on deterministic dynamical equations is explained in this review. Basic formulations and their recent extensions of two constant temperature molecular dynamics methods; the constraint and the extended system methods, are discussed. In both methods, the canonical distribution is derived analytically as a stationary solution of a generalized Liouville's equation which expresses the conservation of probability in a phase space. In the constraint method, the total kinetic energy of a system is kept to a constant by imposing a constraint. The extended system method replaces a macroscopic heat bath by an additional degree of freedom. The addition of only one degree of freedom is enough to derive the canonical distribution. Originally, the control of the kinetic energy is aimed, but recent developments reveal that the canonical distribution is attained by controlling only a ratio of any pair of quantities to a ratio of their canonical enseJ:!lble averages. The method is now applicable even to a system which does not have a kinetic energy term. A classical spin system is a typical example.},
