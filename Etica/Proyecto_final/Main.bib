  abstract = {The article presents the key tenets regarding responsible behavior in research, before providing information about unethical conduct expressed by 17 postgraduate program coordinators from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and 14 lecturers from three universities in Valencia, Spain. The theoretical frame derives primarily from the specialized literature in Mexico, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The research findings emphasize the importance of the international documents, while concluding that the perception of unethical conduct is greater than its actual prevalence in the university setting. The findings also outline the range of unethical practices, while highlighting the existence of internal and external detection mechanisms.},

@article{Reich2009,
  abstract = {This is the story of wunderkind physicist Jan Hendrik Sch{\"{o}}n who faked the discovery of a new superconductor made from plastic. A star researcher at the world-renowned Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, he claimed to have stumbled across a powerful method for making carbon-based crystals into transistors, the switches found on computer chips. Had his experiments worked, they would have paved the way for huge advances in technology--computer chips that we could stick on a dress or eyewear, or even use to make electronic screens as thin and easy-to-fold as sheets of paper. But as other researchers tried to recreate Sch{\"{o}}n's experiments, the scientific community learned that it had been duped. Why did so many top experts, including Nobel prize-winners, support Sch{\"{o}}n? What led the major scientific journals to publish his work, and promote it with press releases? And what drove Sch{\"{o}}n, by all accounts a mild-mannered, modest and obliging young man, to tell such outrageous lies?},

Subsequently it looks at a number of currently discussed ethical issues in clinical research ethics, notably the ethics standards of clinical trials in developing countries, the use of prisoners and incompetent people in clinical research, and the modus operandi of research ethics committees.
